### Project Documentation: BMI Calculator

---

#### Project Overview
The BMI Calculator is a web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The project is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and accessible. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive interface for users to easily input their data and receive their BMI result along with a health interpretation.

#### Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main structure of the application is created using HTML. It includes a header with the title of the application, a form where users can input their height and weight, and a section where the BMI result is displayed.

- **styles.css**: This file contains the styling for the application. It ensures that the layout is clean and visually appealing, with responsive design elements that adapt to different screen sizes.

- **script.js**: This JavaScript file handles the logic for calculating the BMI. It takes the user's input, performs the necessary calculations, and dynamically updates the webpage to display the result along with an interpretation of the BMI value.

#### Project Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Real-time Calculation**: As soon as the user submits their data, the BMI is calculated and displayed instantly.
- **BMI Interpretation**: The application not only calculates BMI but also provides an interpretation (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese).
